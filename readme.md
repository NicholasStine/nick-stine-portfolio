# Nick Stine Portfolio App
### An open source showcase to showcase that I've got skillz with which I can pay my billz

## The problem at hand

I've got three primary problems that I'd like to solve with this portfolio
1. Can clients trust that I can actually do what I say I can do?
2. Are my UX/UI designs professional, and worth paying for?
3. How do I widen and shorten my sales funnel beyond the capabilities of freelance platforms (Upwork, Fivver, etc.)?

## The action plan

### Skill Showcase
If it's not already out of style, I'm definitely going to do a fancy carousel of my projects with links to different pages on the site showcasing some common requested skills on Upwork. If a carousel is played out, I need a creative way of showing off all my projects with mouse hover accenting for desktop and scroll position accenting for mobile.

The skills I'd like to showcase include:
- Stripe Payment Integration
- Login Page with email / pass and the three big boys of oAuth; Google, Facebook and Apple
- Youtube API integration
- Facebook API integration
- Zoom API integration
- SOMETHING WITH CRYPTO
- Data and Statistics Visualization (probably a good chance to play with the NASA api's!!!)
- Lead Generation (content gates)
- Google Maps Integration
- Docker! Just write an article on how I dockerized this app and deployed it to Heroku!


### UX / UI

I'd like to use a three color scheme, black, white, and an accent? Probably some different shades of saphire to accent and border parts of the site and compliment some images of meee

Those portraits need to happen asap! I'm thinking I could probably get the ol' DSLR charged up and take some really fun and some more serious portraits to paint a full picture of what I'm about!

Routing should be organized as follows
#### '/' - The Landing Page

#### '/skills' - A showcase of portfolio projects

#### '/consultation' - A scheduling page, probably with zoom and calendarly integrations

#### '/testimonials' - Real client feedback
